# Fauxlizer Minimal API

This is a small console API project which illustrates a few of the core fauxlizer operations (parse, validate, summary and retrieve row in an alternate format), dables with semigroups and monoids (from category theory) as well as other functional programming concepts.

## Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) 3.8 or higher

## Runner

* Navigate into the Fauxlizer directory and run the command below.

* > python src/fauxlizer.py
 
* The command above will run __main__ inside of fauxlizer.py 

* Alternatively, you can run the more functional version

* > python src/alternative/fauxl.py

## Project structure

### Python

The project only contains 3 python files: source files (.py) in `src`, 2 source files (.py) in `alternative` & fauxlizer data files in the `data_files` folder.
