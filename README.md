# Fauxlizer Minimal API

This is a small API project which illustrates a few of the core fauxlizer operations (parse, validate, summary and retrieve row in an alternate format), dables with semigroups and monoids (from category theory) as well as other functional programming concepts.

## Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) 3.8 or higher

## Test runner

* Navigate to into the Fauxlizer directory and run the command below.

* > python src/fauxlizer.py
 
* The command above will run __main__ inside of fauxlizer.py 


## Project structure

### Python

The project only contains 3 python files: source files (.py) in the `src` & fauxlizer data files in the `data_files` folder.
